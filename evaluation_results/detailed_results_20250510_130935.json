    "bot_response": " Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects around 300 million people globally. It's characterized by inflammation in the airways, leading to symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, viral infections, or pollutants. Asthma can worsen with exposure to cold, dry air. It's important to note that asthma severity isn't always accurately measured by symptoms alone due to the complexity of the disease. Treatment often involves controlling inflammation and managing triggers to prevent attacks.",
    "reference_response": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to breathing difficulties and recurring symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. It's not curable but can be managed effectively with medications and lifestyle changes.",
