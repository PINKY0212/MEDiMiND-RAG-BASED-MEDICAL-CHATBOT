There are two types of ultravioletrays, UV A and UVB. UV A rays penetrate the skin moredeeply and can cause melanoma in susceptible people.UVB rays, which don’t penetrate as deeply, cause sun-burn and wrinkling. Most UVB rays are absorbed by sun-\\n\\nsunburn and, possibly, skin cancer. Some dermatologistshave suggested that taking vitamins E and C may helpprevent sunburn. In one particular study, men and womentook these vitamins for eight days prior to being exposedto ultraviolet light. The researchers found that those whoconsumed vitamins required about 20% more ultravioletlight to induce sunburn than did people who didn’t takevitamins. This is the first study that indicates the oral useof vitamins E and C increases resistance to sunburn.These\\n\\nWhen the sun burns the skin, it triggers immune\\ndefenses which identify the burned skin as foreign.
