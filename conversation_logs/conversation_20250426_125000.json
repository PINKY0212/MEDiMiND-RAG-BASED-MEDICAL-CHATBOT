    "bot_response": " To help manage excessive asthma attacks, doctors often prescribe two main types of medications: quick-relief and controller drugs.\n\n   Quick-relief medications (also known as bronchodilators) are used to quickly open up your airways when you're having an asthma attack or symptoms. They usually come in the form of an inhaler and include short-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists like albuterol (Ventolin).\n\n   Controller medications, on the other hand, are taken daily to reduce inflammation in your airways and prevent asthma attacks. These are often corticosteroids, such as budesonide (Pulmicort) or fluticasone (Flovent), which help control the underlying inflammation that causes asthma symptoms over time.\n\n   It's important to note that while these medications can effectively manage asthma symptoms, they don't cure the disease. New treatments are being developed, including potential vaccines and immune therapies, but their development is still in progress.\n\n   If you suspect you have asthma or are experiencing worsening symptoms, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and management.",

            "assistant": " Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease that affects around 300 million people worldwide. It can cause breathing difficulties and is often triggered by external factors such as allergens, viral infections, or pollutants. The symptoms can vary over time due to these triggers.\n\n   In some cases, the simple inhalation of cold and dry air can worsen asthma symptoms. This is because the protective functions of the nose may be compromised in people with asthma, leading to a decrease in FEV1 (a measure of lung function).\n\n   It's important to note that while cold air can sometimes help distinguish between asthma and other conditions, the distinction is becoming less clear.\n\n   Assessing the severity and control of asthma based on symptoms alone has limitations due to the complexity of the disease. A more comprehensive approach, considering multiple factors, is often necessary for proper management.\n\n   Asthma can have significant impacts on health, leading to numerous hospitalizations and emergency room visits. It also imposes indirect costs and is one of the leading causes of work absences.",

            "assistant": " Asthma symptoms can include:\n\n   1. Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n   2. Wheezing or whistling sounds when exhaling\n   3. Chest tightness or pain\n   4. Coughing, especially at night or early morning\n   5. Cold air or exercise-induced asthma symptoms\n\nIn some cases, you might also experience fatigue, headaches, and itching (although these are less common and could indicate other conditions). It's important to note that the symptoms can vary from person to person and may change over time due to triggers.

            " The document mentions two classes of drugs currently used to manage excessive Asthma attacks: improved corticosteroids (with improved pharmacokinetics) and Î²2-adrenoceptor agonists (with longer duration of action). However, it does not specify specific drug names within these categories. It's always best to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized medication recommendations based on individual health conditions.",
            " The document suggests that in treating asthma, various pharmacopoeias (drugs) may be used, including those targeting the leucotriene pathway. Additionally, it mentions the potential development of vaccines and immune therapies directed against Treg and Th17 cells, such as combinations of vitamin D3 and steroids. However, it's important to note that distinct subgroups of patients may respond better to particular therapies, and a definitive cure or prevention is currently remote.",
            " The document mentions two types of drugs used to manage excessive Asthma attacks: agonists like Indacaterol (QAB149), which has a duration of over 24 hours, making it suitable for once-daily dosing, and Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are the most effective controllers of asthma."
