            "bot_response": " Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that causes breathing difficulties. It's characterized by narrowing and swelling of the airways, making it hard to breathe. This reaction can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, cold air, stress, or infections. In some cases, regular exposure to certain substances at work can lead to asthma (occupational asthma). Asthma can be serious and even life-threatening for people with weakened immune systems. If you suspect you have asthma, it's important to consult a healthcare professional.",

            "bot_response": " Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells in body organs or tissues. It can develop in any tissue, but commonly affects major organs like lungs, breasts, intestines, skin, stomach, pancreas, nasal sinuses, testes, ovaries, lips, tongue, etc. Symptoms may include a firm, painless swelling of the affected area. Diagnosis often involves tests such as ultrasound scanning and measuring hormone levels in the body. Treatment usually involves anticancer drugs.

            "bot_response": " Plague is a severe, potentially life-threatening infectious disease primarily transmitted by rodent fleas. It has caused major pandemics throughout history. There are three main forms: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Bubonic plague affects the lymph nodes, causing swelling, while pneumonic plague targets the lungs and can be spread person-to-person through cough droplets. Septicemic plague, which doesn't involve lymph glands, is particularly dangerous as it can be difficult to diagnose and may affect other organs like the liver, kidneys, or brain. If you suspect you have plague, seek immediate medical attention.",
