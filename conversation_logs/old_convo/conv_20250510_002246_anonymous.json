            "user_message": "What is Asthma?",
            "bot_response": " Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects around 300 million people globally. It's characterized by inflammation in the airways, leading to symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, viral infections, or pollutants. Asthma can worsen with exposure to cold, dry air. It's important to note that asthma severity isn't always accurately measured by symptoms alone due to the complexity of the disease. Treatment often involves controlling inflammation and managing triggers to prevent attacks.",

            "bot_response": " Asthma symptoms include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. These can be triggered by various factors like allergens, viral infections, or pollutants. Other symptoms may include fatigue, headaches, and itching (though this is less common). In severe cases, asthma might lead to jaundice due to nutritional deficiencies. It's important to note that symptoms can vary greatly among individuals. If you experience these symptoms, consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.",

            "bot_response": " Currently, there are several drugs used to manage asthma symptoms. These include inhalers containing corticosteroids, long-acting beta2-agonists, and combination inhalers that contain both. Additionally, leukotriene modifiers like montelukast (Singulair) can help prevent asthma attacks. However, it's important to note that while these drugs can control symptoms, there are currently no known cures or prevention methods for asthma. The pharmaceutical industry is actively researching new treatments, such as immune therapies and vaccines, but these are still in development. Always consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.",

            "bot_response": " Cancer is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the body. It can affect any part of the body and is often characterized by unusual symptoms such as lumps, pain, or changes in bowel and bladder functions. The most common cancer in women is cervical cancer, which may be caused by HPV (Human Papillomavirus). Treatment for cancer depends on the type and stage of the disease, but it often involves surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these methods. It's important to note that early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Regular screenings and consultations with healthcare professionals are crucial for prevention and early detection.",

However, this is not confirmed as the document does not provide a clear name for the disease. It's always best to consult a healthcare professional for accurate information.",
