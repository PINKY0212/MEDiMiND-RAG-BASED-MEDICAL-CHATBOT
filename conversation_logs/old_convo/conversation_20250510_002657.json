            "assistant": " Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects around 300 million people globally. It's characterized by inflammation in the airways, leading to symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, viral infections, or pollutants. Asthma can worsen with exposure to cold, dry air. It's important to note that asthma severity isn't always accurately measured by symptoms alone due to the complexity of the disease. Treatment often involves controlling inflammation and managing triggers to prevent attacks.",
