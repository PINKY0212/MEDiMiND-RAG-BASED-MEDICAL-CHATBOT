    "bot_response": " Asthma is a condition that affects your airways, causing them to narrow and swell, leading to breathing difficulties. Symptoms can include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, cold air, respiratory infections, stress, or certain substances at work (occupational asthma). In some cases, there may be no identifiable triggers. It's important to note that while asthma is generally treatable and controllable, it can produce serious infections and, in severe cases, can even be fatal, especially for those with weakened immunity.",
