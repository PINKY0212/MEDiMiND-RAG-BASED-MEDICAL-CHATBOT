    "bot_response": " Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects around 300 million people worldwide, with numbers expected to rise. It's characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways in the lungs, leading to breathing difficulties. This condition can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, viral infections, or pollutants.\n\n   The disease is complex, and its severity cannot always be accurately assessed based on a single clinical marker like symptoms. There are two main pathways involved: the respiratory pathway, where the loss of protective functions of the nose can contribute to the problem, and the systemic pathway, which involves interactions between the organism and the environment.\n\n   For instance, inhaling cold and dry air can worsen symptoms in asthmatic patients. However, distinguishing asthma from other conditions is not always straightforward, as the boundaries are starting to blur. It's important to note that the triggers for asthma can vary greatly and show high temporal variability.\n\n   Asthma has significant health and economic impacts, accounting for one out of every 250 deaths worldwide and leading to numerous emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Despite its prevalence, there is ongoing research to better understand and manage this condition.",
