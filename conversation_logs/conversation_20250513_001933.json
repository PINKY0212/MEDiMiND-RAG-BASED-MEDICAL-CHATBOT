It can be triggered by various factors like allergens, cold air, stress, or infections. In some cases, regular exposure to certain substances at work (occupational asthma) may cause it. There are about 200 symptoms of asthma, and it can be serious or even fatal for people with weakened immunity. It's important to note that asthma doesn't always have identifiable allergic triggers when it starts in adulthood.",
