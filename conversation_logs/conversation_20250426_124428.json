    "bot_response": " Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease that affects around 300 million people worldwide. It can cause breathing difficulties and is often triggered by external factors such as allergens, viral infections, or pollutants. The symptoms can vary over time due to these triggers.\n\n   In some cases, the simple inhalation of cold and dry air can worsen asthma symptoms. This is because the protective functions of the nose may be compromised in people with asthma, leading to a decrease in FEV1 (a measure of lung function).\n\n   It's important to note that while cold air can sometimes help distinguish between asthma and other conditions, the distinction is becoming less clear.\n\n   Assessing the severity and control of asthma based on symptoms alone has limitations due to the complexity of the disease. A more comprehensive approach, considering multiple factors, is often necessary for proper management.\n\n   Asthma can have significant impacts on health, leading to numerous hospitalizations and emergency room visits. It also imposes indirect costs and is one of the leading causes of work absences.",

            " Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to recurring symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. It can be triggered by various factors including allergens, cold air, exercise, or irritants. The interaction between the upper and lower airways plays a significant role in asthma, with mechanisms involving both respiratory (loss of protective functions of the nose) and systemic pathways (affecting the entire body).",
            " Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to recurring symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms can be triggered by various external factors like viral infections, allergens, and pollutants, which may show high temporal variability. The severity and control of asthma are complex and cannot be accurately assessed based on a single clinical marker such as the average set of symptoms. Instead, a multidimensional approach considering multiple factors is recommended for proper evaluation.",
            " Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide, with an expected rise in cases, particularly among children, over the next 15-20 years. It is responsible for about one out of every 250 global deaths and has significant healthcare costs due to emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Asthma also carries substantial indirect costs and is a leading cause of work absences."
