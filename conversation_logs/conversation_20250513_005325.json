    "bot_response": " Plague is a severe, potentially life-threatening infectious disease, historically known for causing pandemics. It's usually transmitted to humans by fleas on rodents and can take three forms: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Bubonic plague causes swollen lymph nodes, while pneumonic plague affects the lungs and can be spread person-to-person through cough droplets. Septicemic plague, which doesn't involve lymph glands, is particularly dangerous as it can be hard to diagnose. Symptoms include fever, chills, abdominal pain, shock, and bleeding into the skin and organs. If you suspect you have been exposed, seek medical help immediately.",

This reaction can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, cold air, stress, or infections. In some cases, regular exposure to certain substances at work may cause asthma (occupational asthma). Asthma can produce serious infections, especially in people with weakened immune systems. It's important to note that there are about 200 symptoms of asthma, and it can be fatal if not managed properly.",
