Coughing, especially at night or early morning\n   5. Cold air or exercise-induced asthma symptoms\n\nIn some cases, you might also experience fatigue, headaches, and itching (although these are less common and could indicate other conditions). It's important to note that the symptoms can vary from person to person and may change over time due to triggers.

            "assistant": " Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease that affects around 300 million people worldwide. It can cause breathing difficulties and is often triggered by external factors such as allergens, viral infections, or pollutants. The symptoms can vary over time due to these triggers.\n\n   In some cases, the simple inhalation of cold and dry air can worsen asthma symptoms. This is because the protective functions of the nose may be compromised in people with asthma, leading to a decrease in FEV1 (a measure of lung function).\n\n   It's important to note that while cold air can sometimes help distinguish between asthma and other conditions, the distinction is becoming less clear.\n\n   Assessing the severity and control of asthma based on symptoms alone has limitations due to the complexity of the disease. A more comprehensive approach, considering multiple factors, is often necessary for proper management.\n\n   Asthma can have significant impacts on health, leading to numerous hospitalizations and emergency room visits. It also imposes indirect costs and is one of the leading causes of work absences.",
