    "bot_response": " Asthma is a common long-term (chronic) inflammatory disease that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. It can be more prevalent in children and its numbers are expected to increase over the next 15-20 years. Asthma is not usually fatal, but it can lead to emergency room visits and hospitalizations.\n\n   The disease causes the airways (tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs) to become inflamed and narrowed, making breathing difficult. This response can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, viral infections, or pollutants. Cold and dry air can also sometimes trigger asthma symptoms.\n\n   The severity and control of asthma are complex due to the multifaceted nature of the disease. A single clinical marker like symptoms may not accurately reflect its status. Therefore, a comprehensive approach that considers multiple factors is often used for assessment.\n\n   In simpler terms, asthma is a condition where your airways become inflamed and narrowed, making it hard to breathe. It can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, viruses, pollutants, or cold air. Despite its challenges, proper management can help control the symptoms and prevent serious complications.",

            " Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways in the lungs, leading to recurring symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. The condition can be triggered by various factors including allergens, cold or dry air, exercise, and irritants. It's important to note that asthma severity varies among individuals and effective management often involves avoiding triggers, medication, and lifestyle modifications.",
            " Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to recurrent symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. It can be triggered by various factors including viral infections, allergens, and pollutants, which may show high temporal variability. The severity and control of asthma are complex and cannot be accurately assessed based on a single clinical marker like the average set of symptoms due to the multidimensional nature of the disease.",
            " Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide, with an expected increase of around 100 million cases in the next 15-20 years, particularly among children. It accounts for about one out of every 250 global deaths and has significant healthcare costs due to emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Asthma also carries substantial indirect costs and is a leading cause of work absenteeism."
